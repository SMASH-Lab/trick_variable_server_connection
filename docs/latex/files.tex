\item\contentsline{section}{src/\hyperlink{trick__variable__server__connection_8c}{trick\+\_\+variable\+\_\+server\+\_\+connection.\+c} \\*The library provides a set of C functions to connect and interact to a Trick Variable Server }{\pageref{trick__variable__server__connection_8c}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{test/\hyperlink{test01__set__one__reading_8c}{test01\+\_\+set\+\_\+one\+\_\+reading.\+c} \\*This is a simple test that shows how to connect and interact to a Trick Variable Server for querying and reading simulation data (just one reading). The source simulation is the S\+I\+M\+\_\+cannon\+\_\+jet reported in the Trick Tutorial \char`\"{}\+Trick Simulation Environment User Training Materials Trick 2013.\+0 Release\char`\"{}, see Section 9.\+0 and subsequent. The program takes as first input parameter the port number on which the Trick Variable Server is active. The server is supposed to run locally. If not, the IP address must be provided after the port number as the second input parameter }{\pageref{test01__set__one__reading_8c}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{test/\hyperlink{test02__set__multiple__readings_8c}{test02\+\_\+set\+\_\+multiple\+\_\+readings.\+c} \\*This is a simple test that shows how to connect and interact to a Trick Variable Server for querying and reading simulation data until they are provided by the Server. The source simulation is the S\+I\+M\+\_\+cannon\+\_\+jet reported in the Trick Tutorial \char`\"{}\+Trick Simulation Environment User Training Materials Trick 2013.\+0 Release\char`\"{}, see Section 9.\+0 and subsequent.
